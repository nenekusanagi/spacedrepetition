### Spaced Repetition Flashcard Software

This software serves as a program for the user to create their own flashcards (question and answer) and decks, and then review them based on a priority (spaced repetition) algorithm.

The program requires the user to sign up and make an account.

You may turn on or off friend requests and peer marking (elaborated on later). 

Friends can be added by inputting their username into a "friends list" window. A friend request will then be sent to them, which they can accept or deny. 

Decks can be created, from which flashcards can be created and added within them.

Decks can be reviewed, from which 10 flashcards will be chosen based on the level of their priority (or randomly if the deck has never been reviewed before).

For each flashcard, you will view the question and input your answer to the question.

The flashcard can then be flipped to review the answer, and it will have a side-by-side comparison with your inputted answer.

From there you can decide how well you responded to the question using 4 different ratings (fail, hard, good, easy), which then affects the priority of the flashcard.

The options "fail" and "hard" increase the priority of the flashcard. The higher the priority of the flashcard, the more you will come across it during deck reviews, and the opposite occurs for flashcards with a lower priority. 

If you are unsure about how well you responded to the question, or feel that you may be biased towards yourself when choosing the rating, you may select a "peer mark" option, which is only available if you have added friends (which have peer marking turned on).

At the end of the deck review, if you have selected any flashcards to be "peer marked", they will one-by-one be displayed to the user, who can then choose a friend to send their flashcard and inputted answer to. 

The chosen friend will then receive the flashcard and inputted answer in their inbox, from where they can review the flashcard's question, original answer and user's answer, and choose the option they see fit (without bias which may have influenced the choice of the rating if the sender had reviewed it themself).

The recipient may also provide their own feedback if they wish.

The chosen rating, and any feedback, will then be sent back to the sender in their inbox; the rating will affect the final priority of the flashcard until its next review.
